# ImThemes for Openplanet
These are the themes from [ImThemes](https://github.com/Patitotective/ImThemes) ported to the Openplanet overlay style format, and usable in [Overlay Style Manager](https://openplanet.dev/plugin/stylemanager).

The `.toml` and `.json` files are automatically generated by [`convert.py`](convert.py). Simply run that script to update the styles in this repository. Screenshots, however, need to be taken manually.
